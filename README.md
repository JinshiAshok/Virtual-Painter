# Virtual-Painter

Description:
The Virtual Painter is an interactive computer vision application that turns your hand movements into a virtual painting experience. Developed using Python and OpenCV, the application tracks hand gestures using a webcam, allowing users to draw on a virtual canvas with different colors and an eraser tool. Users can select colors by hovering over predefined color zones with their hand, and drawing is done by moving the index finger in the air. The application also features a real-time frames-per-second (FPS) display.
